Scrape PFF for NFL stats - Season stats and individual game data

The top part of the code is used to scrape season data between a number of years, followed by code to clean the data and extract the passers, rushers, and receivers for pulling individual game data.  Individual game data takes a while to run if there are a lot of years you are scraping.
